I know, sourdough is so hot right now. The quarantine has led some of us to aggressively pursue learning to bake bread at home, among other life skills.

This magical fermentation of lactic acid-producing bacteria and wild yeast has loomed large in my heart for about a year now. In my pre-quarantine life, my starter (his name is Frisco) would relax all week long in the fridge. On Friday, I’d pop him out for a refresh, which would be followed by a weekend of twice-daily feedings and bread baking. Sunday night, back in the fridge he would go. Repeat.

As you might expect, now that I’m home for the foreseeable future, Frisco has gotten extra love. Less time in the fridge, more time on the counter and in use, and of course, more feedings. Which means I quickly realized I was feeding him the hard way.

Up until now, and not because anyone advised me to do it, and not for any particular reason other than habit, I had done feedings like this:

- Get clean jar. Add 20g of ripe starter.
- Measure 50g of whole wheat and 50g of all purpose flour into the jar, pouring over ripe starter.
- Add 100g of water.
- Mix with long spatula. Cover jar.

The part not explicitly mentioned in these instructions is that mixing this way was kind of a pain. Jars are great for getting a clear view of fermentation activity, and long spatulas are great for reaching down into them without making a mess of things. I’m doing everything “right,” right?

But in my process of immediately dumping dry flour over such a small portion of a goopy ingredient, and THEN adding my liquid—in pursuit of an ultimately goopy result—I was making things harder for myself than I needed to.

Quite literally 100% of the time, I would struggle (yes, even with the carefully-selected, convenient, long spatula, procured just for this purpose) to evenly mix dry into wet. The flour would always leave a chalky residue along the sides of the jar, and I’d always have to be extra careful to get it fully incorporated. Occasionally I would miss a few spots and get a little unincorporated flour left over in my end product. Not exactly world-ending. Just annoying.

_Just_ annoying enough to make me dread the process if my patience was thin that particular day.

Which meant _just_ annoying enough to sometimes skip a feeding altogether if I’d had a particularly hard time getting my toddler to bed that night and wanted to go relax instead.

Which meant _just_ annoying enough to make a snap decision that indirectly meant I would forgo making bread at all the next day, because I wouldn’t be equipped to do it with an unfed starter. (Which also meant just annoying enough to compromise the overall health of my starter, because once they’re out of food, they start producing alcohol, like any other fermented product.)

But hey, what if instead of dumping dry flour into the bottom of the jar first, I started with the water? **#quarantinethoughts**

It turns out that creates an ideal base layer that is ready to accept the flour. It mixes right in. No chalky reside. Less aggressive stirring required. Quicker process. Less irritation.

Problem solved. But I did it the hard way for a year. Just because I hadn’t really thought about it, and had fallen into a habit.

What else in my life am I doing the hard way? What other problem might be solved without aggressive upheaval, with just a little nudge, a gentle reordering of steps, to make it not a problem at all?
